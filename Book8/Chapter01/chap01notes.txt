Working with Files

===============================================================

In this chapter, you discover the ins and outs of working with files and directories.

*Using a File Visitor to Walk a File Tree
-----------------------------------------
1. Create a file-visitor class, which is extended from FileVisitor or, more
often, SimpleFileVisitor.
The SimpleFileVisitor class defines several methods that are called for
every file in the file tree,

2.In the file visitor, override one or more methods that are defined by the
SimpleFileVisitor class.
These methods are where you write the code that you want to execute for
every file visited when the directory tree is walked. You always want to override
at least three of the methods explained kin the book, or you can go through the code to understand better:
• visitFile, which is called for every file in the file tree
• visitFileFailed, which is called for every file that can’t be accessed
(usually due to permissions issues)
• preVisitDirectoryFailed, which is called for every directory that
couldn’t be accessed

3. Create a Path object that indicates the starting point (that is, the root) of
the file tree you want to walk.
If you want to visit all the files on your C: drive, for example, this path should
point to C:\.

4. Call the walkFileTree method of the static Files class to process the
files.
This method takes just two arguments: the Path object (which identifies the
root of your file tree) and an instance of your file-visitor class
