What is a Thread in Java?
 ~~~A thread in Java is the direction or path that is taken while a program is being executed.
   Generally, all the programs have at least one thread, known as the main thread,
   that is provided by the JVM or Java Virtual Machine at the starting of the programâ€™s
   execution.

common example: Sometimes, we want to perform several tasks at once. The computer can do this 
by using Threads. You might be reading this post and listening to music at the same time
 since your computer is using threads to run both processes.
